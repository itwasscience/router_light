# RouterLightUi

A GUI for the NERV UI frontend. Follow the typical Phoenix instructions to install below.

There are only two pages:

`/` - Index - Shows the live connection monitor - **Should not be used unless the firmware is 
also running**

`/mock` - Shows a mock dashboard fed with fake data for dashboard testing - If you are
just curious about the project this is the path you want to run as it doesn't rely on 
any firmware functionality.
